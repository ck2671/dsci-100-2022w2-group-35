    "   Heart disease has been the leading cause of death in many countries (Namara et. al, 2022). High blood pressure is one of the main risk factors for heart disease among various others. With high blood pressure, the heart arteries become damaged by elasticity loss, which decreases the flow of blood to heart and leads to a heart disease (Fuchs et.al, 2020). Sex difference is also found to be a risk factor since scientists had proved that the associations between high blood pressure and heart disease were not equivalent in women and men (Colafella et.al, 2018). From this knowledge, we came up with a predictive question: what is the likelihood of developing heart disease based on blood pressure and sex? \n",
    "\n",
    "   We are going to use classification with K-nearest neighbors to answer our predictive question. The dataset we used contains 14 patient attributes which are relevant to the heart disease: age, sex, chest pain, resting blood pressure, …, and heart disease diagnosis. We will use sex, blood pressure and heart disease diagnosis to answer this question. \n"

    "For our project, we are more interested in finding out whether or not heart disease is present in an individual, rather than the level of heart disease severity (0, 1, 2, 3, 4). Therefore, we grouped all heart disease diagnosis levels of 0 into one group (represented by 0) and we grouped all heart disease diagnosis levels of 1, 2, 3, and 4, into one group into one group (represented by 1). The group represented by 0 indicates no heart disease present, while the group represented by 1 indicates the presence of heart disease. Even though we usually would not touch the testing data, in this instance we need to perform this grouping for both the training and testing data to ensure that the heart diagnosis is grouped in the same manner for both. If we do not do this, then when we try and test the model, the predictions will not be accurate since it would be on a different scale. "
