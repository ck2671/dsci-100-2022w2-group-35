    "   Heart disease has been the leading cause of death in many countries (Namara et. al, 2022). High blood pressure is one of the main risk factors for heart disease among various others. With high blood pressure, the heart arteries become damaged by elasticity loss, which decreases the flow of blood to heart and leads to a heart disease (Fuchs et.al, 2020). Sex difference is also found to be a risk factor since scientists had proved that the associations between high blood pressure and heart disease were not equivalent in women and men (Colafella et.al, 2018). From this knowledge, we came up with a predictive question: what is the likelihood of developing heart disease based on blood pressure and sex? \n",

    "   We are going to use classification with K-nearest neighbors to answer our predictive question. The dataset we used contains 14 patient attributes which are relevant to the heart disease: age, sex, chest pain, resting blood pressure, …, and heart disease diagnosis. We will use sex, blood pressure and heart disease diagnosis to answer this question. \n"

Then we used this new column to make a box plot to see how accurate the model is based on our predictors. Although this box plot wasn’t very helpful to evaluate our models analysis, therefore we decided to see the model’s accuracy based on each of the predictors separately. The plot was created using ggplot, with geom_boxplot as a box plot was one of the best way to display the data since sex is a binary value. Also we used used facet_grid to create two separate visualisations one on top of each other, divided by sex to allow for better analysis. "
